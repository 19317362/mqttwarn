# mqttwarn

To _warn_, _alert_, or _notify_.

![definition by Google](assets/jmbp-841.jpg)

This program subscribes to any number of MQTT topics (which may include wildcards) and publishes received payloads to one or more notification services, including support for notifying more than one distinct service for the same message.

For example, you may wish to notify via e-mail and to Pushover of an alarm published as text to the MQTT topic `home/monitoring/+`.

Support for the following services is available:

* files (output to files on the file system)
* MQTT. Yes, outgoing MQTT, e.g. as a republisher to same or different broker
* Pushover.net
* Twitter
* SMTP (e-mail)
* NMA
* Prowl
* XBMC
* Mac OS X notification center

Notifications are transmitted to the appropriate service via plugins. We provide plugins for the above list of services, and you can easily add your own.

In addition to passing the payload received via MQTT to a service, _mqttwarn_ allows you do do the following:

* Transform payloads on a per/topic basis. For example, you know you'll be receiving JSON, but you want to warn with a nicely formatted message.
* For certain services, you can change the _title_ (or _subject_) of the outgoing message.

Consider the following JSON payload published to the MQTT broker:

```shell
mosquitto_pub -t 'osx/json' -m '{"fruit":"banana", "price": 63, "tst" : "1391779336"}'
```

Using the `formatmap` we can configure _mqttwarn_ to transform that JSON into a different outgoing message which is the text that is actually notified. Part of said `formatmap` looks like this in the configuration file, and basically specified that messages published to `osx/json` should be transformed as on the right-hand side.

```python
formatmap = {
'osx/json'          :  "I'll have a {fruit} if it costs {price}",
}
```

The result is:

You associate MQTT topic branches to applications in the configuration file (copy `mqttwarn.conf.sample` to `mqttwarn.conf` for use). In other words, you can accomplish, say, following mappings:

* PUBs to `owntracks/jane/iphone` should be notified via Pushover to John's phone
* PUBs to `openhab/temperature` should be Tweeted
* PUBs to `home/monitoring/alert/+` should notify Twitter, Mail, and Prowl

See details in the config sample for how to configure this script.
The path to the configuration file (which must be valid Python) is obtained from the `MQTTWARNCONF` environment variable which defaults to `mqttwarn.conf` in the current directory.


## Configuration of service plugins

Service plugins are configured in the main `mqttwarn.conf` file. Each service has two mandatory _dict_s:

* `service_config` defines things like connection settings for a service, even though many don't need that. Even so, the _dict_ must be defined (e.g. to `None`).
* `service_targets` defines the notification "targets" we use to associate an incoming MQTT topic with the output (i.e. notificiation) to a service.

We term the array for each target an "address list" for the particular service. These may be path names (in the case of the `file` service), topic names (for outgoing `mqtt` publishes), hostname/port number combinations for `xbmc`, etc.

### `file`

### `mqtt`

The `mqtt` service fires off a publish on a topic, creating a new connection to the configured broker for each message.

Consider the following configuration snippets:

```python
topicmap = {
  'in/a1'  : ['mqtt:o1', 'mqtt:o2'],
}

mqtt_targets = {
  'o1'    : [ 'out/food' ],
  'o2'    : [ 'out/fruit/{fruit}' ],
}

formatmap = {
  'in/a1'  :  u'Since when does a {fruit} cost {price}?',
}

```

The `topicmap` specifies we should subscribe to `in/a1` and republish to two MQTT targets.
The second target (`mqtt:o2`) has a topic branch with a variable in it which is to be
interpolated (`{fruit}`).

These are the results for appropriate publishes:

```
$ mosquitto_pub -t 'in/a1' -m '{"fruit":"pineapple", "price": 131, "tst" : "1391779336"}'

in/a1 {"fruit":"pineapple", "price": 131, "tst" : "1391779336"}
out/food Since when does a pineapple cost 131?
out/fruit/pineapple Since when does a pineapple cost 131?


$ mosquitto_pub -t 'in/a1' -m 'temperature: 12'

in/a1 temperature: 12
out/food temperature: 12
out/fruit/{fruit} temperature: 12
```

In the first case, the JSON payload was decoded and the _fruit_ variable could be
interpolated into the topic name of the outgoing publish, whereas the latter shows
the outgoing topic branch without interpolated values, because they simply didn't
exist in the original incoming payload.

### `osxnotify`

### `prowl`

This service is for [Prowl](http://www.prowlapp.com). Each target requires
an application key and an application name.

```python
prowl_config = None             # This service requires no configuration
prowl_targets = {
                    # application key                           # app name
    'pjpm'    :  [ 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', 'SuperAPP' ],
}
```

* Requires [prowlpy](https://github.com/jacobb/prowlpy)

### `pushover`

### `smtp`

### `twitter`


## Plugins

Creating new plugins is rather easy, and I recommend you take the `file` plugin
and start from that.

Plugins are invoked with two arguments (`srv` and `item`). `srv` is an object
with some helper functions, and `item` a dict which contains information on the message
which is to be handled by the plugin. `item` contains the following elements:

```python
item = {
    'service'       : 'string',       # name of handling service (`twitter`, `file`, ..)
    'target'        : 'string',       # name of target (`o1`, `janejol`) in service
    'config'        : dict,           # None or dict from SERVICE_config {}
    'topic'         : 'string',       # incoming topic branch name
    'payload'       : <payload>       # incoming payload
    'addrs'         : <list>,         # list of addresses from SERVICE_targets
    'fmt'           : None,           # possible format string from formatmap{}
    'data'          : None,           # possible dict if JSON parsed in payload
    'message'       : None,           # possibly transformed payload
    'title'         : None,           # possible title from titlemap{}
    'priority'      : None,           # possible priority from prioritymap{}
}
```

## Advanced features

### Using functions to replace incoming payloads

Consider the following configuration snippet in addition to the configuration
of the `mqtt` service shown above:

```python
def lookup_data(data):
    if type(data) == dict and 'fruit' in data:
            return "Ananas"
    return None

formatmap = {
#   'in/a1'  :  u'Since when does a {fruit} cost {price}?',
    'in/a1'  :  lookup_data,
}
```

We've replaced the `formatmap` entry for the topic by a function which you
define withing the `mqttwarn.conf` configuration file. These functions
are invoked with decoded JSON `data` passed to them. They must return
a string which replaces the outgoing `message`:

```
in/a1 {"fruit":"pineapple", "price": 131, "tst" : "1391779336"}
out/food Ananas
out/fruit/pineapple Ananas
```

### Incorporating topic names into transformation data

An MQTT topic branch name contains information you may want to use in transformations.
As a rather extreme example, consider the [OwnTracks] program (the
artist formerly known as _MQTTitude_).

When an [OwnTracks] device detects a change of a configured waypoint or geo-fence (a region monitoring a user can set up on the device), it emits a JSON payload which looks like this, on a topic name consisting of `owntracks/_username_/_deviceid_`:

```
owntracks/jane/phone -m '{"_type": "location", "lat": "52.4770352" ..  "desc": "Home", "event": "leave"}'
```

In order to be able to obtain the username (`jane`) and her device name (`phone`) for use
in transformations (see previous section), we would ideally want to parse the MQTT topic name and add that to the item data our plugins obtain. Yes, we can.

An optional `topicdatamap` in our configuration file, defines the name of a function we provide, also in the configuration file, which accomplishes that.

```python
topicdatamap = {
    'owntracks/jane/phone' : tdata,
}
```

This specifies that when a message for the defined topic `owntracks/jane/phone` is processed, our function `tdata()` should be invoked to parse that. (As usual, topic names may contain MQTT wildcards.)

The function we define to do that is:

```python
def tdata(topic):
    if type(topic) == str:
            try:
                    # owntracks/username/device
                    parts = topic.split('/')
                    username = parts[1]
                    deviceid = parts[2]
            except:
                    deviceid = 'unknown'
                    username = 'unknown'
            return dict(username=username, device=deviceid)
    return None
```

The returned _dict_ is merged into the transformation data, i.e. it is made available to plugins and to transformation rules (`formatmap`). If we then create the following rule

```python
formatmap = {
    'owntracks/jane/phone' : u'{username}: {event} => {desc}',
}
```

the above PUBlish will be transformed into

```
jane: leave => Home
```

## Requirements

You'll need at least the following components:

* Python 2.x (tested with 2.6 and 2.7)
* An MQTT broker (e.g. [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org))
* The Paho Python module: `pip install paho-mqtt`

Depending on the notification services you wish to use, you'll also require one
or more of the following:

* A [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/) account
* A [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account with application keys
* NMA FIXME
* Prowl FIXME
* XBMC FIXME
* Mac OS X notification center: a Mac ;-) and [pync](https://github.com/setem/pync) which uses the binary [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) created by Eloy Dur√°n. Note: upon first launch, `pync` will download and extract `https://github.com/downloads/alloy/terminal-notifier/terminal-notifier_1.4.2.zip` into a directory `vendor/`.
